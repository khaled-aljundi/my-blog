# Remember:

> In the realm of seeking, embark on the unknown,
Embrace the failure, let it be your own.
Embrace rejection, for it teaches resilience,
Seek discomfort to forge strength's brilliance.

> With open arms, welcome the pain's embrace,
For within its depths, growth finds its space.
Seek to be, unbound by fear's restrain,
Eliminate doubts, let confidence sustain.

> You are enough, an embodiment of worth,
Let no voice diminish your inherent birth.
Let them say, let them judge, undeterred,
For your spirit soars, unconditionally heard.

> In every moment, be present and aware,
Embrace life's symphony, its rhythm rare.
Dance to the beats of your heart's own song,
In seeking, discovering where you belong.

> Seek the unknown, seek all that may be,
For in the seeking lies the power to truly see.
With courage as your guide, let your journey unfold,
Embrace the path ahead, as stories untold.

Thank you for taking the time to learn about me. I look forward to the possibilities that lie ahead in our shared passions and endeavors.
